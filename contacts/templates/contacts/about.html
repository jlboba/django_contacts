<div class='about'>
<h4>I began my musical journey as a child by learning the fundamentals of music theory through piano. I was fascinated with rock music and wanted to transition into a more fullfilling path so I took four years of guitar lessons and learned how to play many of my favorite rock songs. I started my first band around age 15 and once a steady lineup had solidified, I started performing live. It opened my eyes to an entire community of like-minded, free thinking intellectuals and I fell in love with the punk rock culture. I continued to hone in on my songwriting skills and had clear desires and goals in mind for producing recorded material. In addition to my portfolio pieces, I have collaborated with countless musicians through writing, recording, and performing locally, nationally, and internationally. I continue to refine my writing process, learn new tecniques, produce new material, and it remains my primary passion. I welcome any new collaboration opportunities and would love to hear from you so feel free to get a hold of me in the <a href="{% url 'contact' %}" id='plain-text'> contacts </a> section. Cheers!<br>
